## About this site

Once I had a spectacular site, a blogging platform written in PHP, then I migrated to Java, hosted on OpenShift.
But I didn't have time to keep up with ever changing environment, so I migrated to [JBake](https://jbake.org) and static files.

If you're looking for the former content, I will add it here once I add JTexy support to JBake.
